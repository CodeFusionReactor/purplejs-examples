Hello Example
=============

This example is very simple. It consists only of one file and returns `Hello World!` on every request. Yes, not very useful, but
it shows how easy you can get started building your application.

To build, run tests and create the zip/tar distribution (`build/distributions`):

```
../gradlew build
```

If you want to run the server in development-mode (no need for server restarts on changes), then execute the following:

```
../gradlew run
```
